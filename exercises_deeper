----------------------------Functions Variables -------------------------------------

Exercise 1. Write function GetPersonPenaltyPoints with parameters:
 - identificationNumber, ex. "9001281173"
 - penalty points - array with penalty points - for each penatly point there should be date - ex. [[new Date(), 1], [new Date(), 3]]
 - age - ex. 29
 - other optional arguments - as many as user would like to have - ex. "Info", 2, true

 Function should build and return such a object:
    {
        message: "9001281173 has less than 26. Points: 10",     - use "more" instead of "less" if age >=26
        points: 10,                                             - create arrow function which will summarize points. 
                                                                  Add only point which has same year as current one
        identificationNumber: identificationNumber,
        firstArg: first,                                        - first element of other arguments
        additional: [...rest]                                   - rest of elements from other arguments
    }

Function should have declared return type



----------------------------Classes Interfaces -------------------------------------

Exercise 1: 

    1.Extend User class with
        - extendUserObject(obj) method where 
            - obj has to contain at least {name: string} and other string properties, for example {name: string, lastName: string, firstName: string, ...}
            - must return typed object  {age: string, name: string, lastName: string, firstName: string, ...}
                - name and other string properties comes from obj parameter
                - age is taken from age property and mapped to string
    2. Create ObjectWithAge abstract class where
        - User should extends ObjectWithAge 
        - declaring constructor for User
        - declaring abstract method getAgeInfo for user
        - User class should extend ObjectWithAge




Exercise 2: Implement list object for string arrays
    - should have methods:
        - add - to add new list element
        - remove - to remove list element by value, so for example remove("Value")
        - first - get first element of list
        - getAll - get all list elements
    - length accesor to get easily length of list, example myList.length
    - it should be possible to easily create new list instance from existing instance, 
        for example let listNextInstance = new MyList(list);



----------------------------Generics & Enums -------------------------------------

Exercise 1: Extend list:
    - make it generic so it will accept all types
    - add method addMultiple, example - list.addMultiple('Value1', 'Value2', ...) will add new elements to list: 'Value1', 'Value2', ...
    - implement where method, example list.where(x=>x.indexOf('3') > 0) will return only element with "3" inside
    - add operation method which can perform both add/remove, example list.operation({operation_type}, "NewElement")



----------------------------Types deeper & Symbols -------------------------------------

Exercise 1: Extend list:
    - extend "operation" metod to handle also first() and getAll() operations;
    - add "isNumber" method which will verify if our MyList elements are number
    - modify "add" method to insert null where there is undefined parameter


Exercise 2: Create Tree handler:
    - first define Tree type with value and child declaration. Sample usage- let family: Tree<string> = {value: "John", child: {value: "Henry", child: null}}
    - create Tree class with
        - tree can have max 3 nodes
        - constructor (private tree: Tree<T> = null)
        - 'pushElement' method to add next child / first element - each element can have one child and one parent only. Tree should have max 3 nodes
        - 'getTree' which will return tree
        - 'isFirstElementPropertyNull' method checking if any of first tree element chosen properties is null. 
            Sample usage - treeBuilder.isFirstElementPropertyNull("value", "child", ...)


Exercise 3: Extend Tree handler:
    - push element shouldn't accept boolean value
    - manage to pass all tests


----------------------------- Modules -----------------------------

Exercise 1: 
- Move MyList class to another file and import it as "List" in exercises/modules/modules.spec.ts (import only List)
- Move GetPersonPenaltyPoints to another file and import it in exercises/modules/modules.spec.ts


---------------------------- Decorators -------------------------------------
Exercise 1: Implement Route, HttpGet and HttpPost decorators to handle proper url and request type




--------------------------------RxJs-----------------------------------------
Exercise 1:
Let's imagine that we are creating poor tweeter.
We have two API methods:
- getTweets()
- getLikers(tweet)
First we are fetching tweets and then likers basing on tweet 
We would like to present it to user in this way:
    TweetName1 LikerName1
    TweetName1 LikerName2
    ...
    TweetName2 LikerName1
    TweetName2 LikerName2
    ...

Let's assume that we have a function showLikers(arr) where arr is string array with value 
for each line

We have to handle Lazy-loading.

Knowing that please handle with all tests in RxJs exercise
